# Contributor's guide

## Commit signing

Enable [commit signing](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)

```sh
git config commit.gpgsign true
```

## Documentation

Unified project documentation is available at https://nethermindeth.github.io/stellar-private-payments/docs/

## Communication and environment notes

- External contributors should mention their PR in the project [LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/18809039/). PRs from forks are not reviewed without this notice because we need to see a human behind the contribution.
- Active development discussions happen in the [Telegram group](https://t.me/stellar_privacy). If you have technical questions you should ask them there.
- You may need to reset local browser storage from time to time. [Bootnode](https://github.com/NethermindEth/stellar-private-payments/issues/169) support is not available yet, and contracts are redeployed during development.

## Prerequisites

- [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 1.92.0 or later (see `rust-toolchain.toml`).
- [**Circom**](https://github.com/iden3/circom) 2.2.2 or later for circuit compilation.
- [**Stellar CLI**](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli) for contract deployment.
- [**Node.js**](https://github.com/nodejs/node) for frontend dependencies.
- [**Trunk**](https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk) for serving the web application.
- [**Cargo Deny**](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny)
- [**Typos**](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos?tab=readme-ov-file#install)
- [**Cargo Sort**](https://github.com/DevinR528/cargo-sort)
- SQLite development libraries (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu `sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev`)
- [**wasm-bindgen-cli**](https://crates.io/crates/wasm-bindgen-cli) (provides `wasm-bindgen-test-runner` for `cargo test --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`)
- [**wasm-pack**](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) for WASM bundling

## Building and testing crates

### Patches

`ark-circom` is [patched](https://github.com/NethermindEth/circom-compat/commits/wasm-no-parallel/) 
(`Cargo.toml` is cleaned up from hardcoded `parallel` features) to allow running 
in a single-threaded WASM - we don't want for now to enable multithreaded wasm support as the proving time is acceptable
while wasm multithreading requires COOP/COEP headers and is much stricter to deploy.
Also we delete `ethereum.rs` module to get rid of many irrelevant dependencies.
`vendor/cranelift-control` is patched - the single dependency `arbitrary` is fixed at the same version as in 
the `soroban-sdk` - see https://github.com/NethermindEth/stellar-private-payments/issues/192.

### Running WASM tests

Some crates include unit tests intended to run under `wasm32-unknown-unknown` via `wasm-bindgen-test`.
The workspace is configured to use `wasm-bindgen-test-runner` as the wasm test runner (see `.cargo/config.toml`),
so you need it available on your `PATH` (typically by installing `wasm-bindgen-cli`).

```bash
# Install a compatible wasm-bindgen toolchain (adjust the version if `Cargo.lock` changes)
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.120

# Example: run wasm tests for the Stellar core crate
cargo test --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p stellar
```

### Building Circuits
To explicitly build them:

```bash
# Build circuits
cargo build -p circuits
```

The circuit crate also exposes 2 flags:
- **BUILD_TESTS**: Builds the circom test circuits. Most Circom circuits simply define a template. And if you want to use it or test it, you need to instantiate it with some specific parameters.
For efficiency, the compilation of these circuits test is gatekeeped behind this flag. When enabled, if the verifying keys are not in `testdata`, it will generate them. Deployed testnet keys are committed under `deployments/testnet/circuit_keys`.
- **REGEN_KEYS**: Forces the generation of new verification keys, even if they already exist.

Also, for efficiency reasons, some tests are ignored by default. To run them:
```bash
# Test circuits requires the flag to be enabled
BUILD_TESTS=1 cargo test -p circuits -- --ignored
```
### Building Contracts

```bash
# Build all contracts
stellar contract build --manifest-path Cargo.toml --out-dir target/stellar --optimize --package pool
stellar contract build --manifest-path Cargo.toml --out-dir target/stellar --optimize --package asp-membership
stellar contract build --manifest-path Cargo.toml --out-dir target/stellar --optimize --package asp-non-membership
stellar contract build --manifest-path Cargo.toml --out-dir target/stellar --optimize --package circom-groth16-verifier

# Or use the deployment script which builds automatically
./deployments/scripts/deploy.sh --help
```

### Deploying Contracts
You can use the script `deployments/scripts/deploy.sh` to deploy contracts to a Stellar network.
An example can be found in the _Demo Application_ section..

See `./deployments/scripts/deploy.sh --help` for all options.


### End-to-End Tests

The E2E tests generate real Groth16 proofs and verify them, locally, using contracts and the Soroban-SDK. To run them:
```bash
cargo test -p e2e-tests
```

## Code quality assurance

Install a pre-push git hook:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## App development

### Prerequisites

* Node.js
* npm
* python3 (for the static server)

The whole app:

```sh
$ make install
$ make serve
```

Prepare a production build (TODO: enable optimizations and minification)

```sh
$ make dist
```
